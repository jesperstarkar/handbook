Introduction:


	This book is meant as a guideline for every member of the Work-Work community. It contains usefull information as well as rules for the co-working space.

	Every new member of the Work-Work community is required to read the house rules, and is encouraged to read the whole handbook. If you have any questions, please contact one of the hosts.

	At Work-Work we really appreciate our community. The people makes the place, so we do not want to force many rules on people, but it is, however, a necessity that there exists some rules.

House Rules:
	
	Intro:
		The house rules are divided into 4 groups. "You Must", "You Should", "You Should not", and "You Can not". The groups should be pretty self explaining. 
		Out of these groups, the most important are "You Must" and "You Can not". These are rules, the "You Should" and "You Should not" are more guidelines than actual rules.


	You must:
		-Obey the "must" and "can't" part of these rules.
		-Clean up after yourself.
		-Tur of the light, and turn the alarm on, if you are the last person to leave the house.
		-read, and be familiar with the HMS-instructions. They are on the walls on every floor.
		-know what is part of the "skjenkeareale", and what is not.
		-know the fire instructions.
		-Respect other peoples private properties. Do not borrow other peoples equipment without their permission. Also don't steal and kill and follow Norwegian law.
		-announce what material is under NDA, if any, prior to showing it to others.
	You should:
		-Follow the "should" and "shouldn't" part of these rules.
		-involve yourself in others work. 
		-help others that ask for help.
		-Give constructive feedback, both positive and negative. Also say what you think, don't be afraid to say things like "I think this part could be better". 
		-talk to people you don't know. Get to know everyone in the community!
		-actively contribute in the "pay it forward" culture. 
		-show other people what you are working on. 
		-be inclusive of people from "the outside". Feel free to invite them in and show them around.
		-use the bar as a prototyping platform. It is your la-BAR-atory. Ask many people, accelerate your development.
	You should not:
		-Break the "should" and "shouldn't" part of these rules.
		-disturb others when they are working.
		-let food and other thrash lay around to rot.
