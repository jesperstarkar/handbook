				<h2>House Rules</h2>
			</header>
			<h3>Intro</h3>
			<p>The house rules are divided into 4 groups. "You Must", "You Should", "You Should not", and "You Can not". The groups should be pretty self explaining. </p>
			<p>Out of these groups, the most important are "You Must" and "You Can not". These are rules, the "You Should" and "You Should not" are more guidelines than actual rules.</p>

			<h3>You must:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Obey the "must" and "can't" part of these rules.<li>
				<li>Clean up after yourself.<li>
				<li>Tur of the light, and turn the alarm on, if you are the last person to leave the house.<li>
				<li>read, and be familiar with the HMS-instructions. They are on the walls on every floor.<li>
				<li>know what is part of the "skjenkeareale", and what is not.<li>
				<li>know the fire instructions.<li>
				<li>Respect other peoples private properties. Do not borrow other peoples equipment without their permission. Also don't steal and kill and follow Norwegian law.<li>
				<li>announce what material is under NDA, if any, prior to showing it to others.<li>
			</ul>
			<h3>You should:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Follow the "should" and "shouldn't" part of these rules.<li>
				<li>involve yourself in others work. <li>
				<li>help others that ask for help.<li>
				<li>Give constructive feedback, both positive and negative. Also say what you think, don't be afraid to say things like "I think this part could be better". <li>
				<li>talk to people you don't know. Get to know everyone in the community!<li>
				<li>actively contribute in the "pay it forward" culture. <li>
				<li>show other people what you are working on. <li>
				<li>be inclusive of people from "the outside". Feel free to invite them in and show them around.<li>
				<li>use the bar as a prototyping platform. It is your la-BAR-atory. Ask many people, accelerate your development.<li>
			</ul>
			<h3>You should not:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Break the "should" and "shouldn't" part of these rules.<li>
				<li>disturb others when they are working.<li>
				<li>let food and other thrash lay around to rot.<li>
				<li>talk negatively to or about other people.<li>
				<li>hide your ideas. By exposing them to other people the ideas grow and become better.<li>
				<li>have material under NDA<li>
			</ul>
			<h3>You can not:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Break the "must" or "can't" part of these rules.<li>
				<li>Access the bar area outside of the opening hours of the bar. <li>
				<li>Bring alcohol to or from the bar area.<li>
